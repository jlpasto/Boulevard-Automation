playwright version should match whats in the Dockerfile
Playwright requires greenlet==3.1.1 when using version 1.48.0.
In requirements.txt, pinned major libraries only , instead of usidng pip freeze

âœ… Best Practices Checklist
 Headless mode: Always headless=True.
 Environment secrets: Never hard-code.
 Session persistence: Use context.storage_state + mounted volume if needed.
 Async everywhere: Use async_playwright to avoid blocking.
 Logging & error handling: Add structured logs for debugging.
 Scaling: Use job queues (e.g. Celery, Redis) if tasks become heavy
